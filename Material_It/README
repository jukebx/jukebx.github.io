Now, the for the README.

Hint: You might want to un-minify all the code supplied. That would be a good idea! 

SECTION 1: Header
	When adding links, make sure you also add them to the shrunken version, found in the material_it.html as the first "div.article" in "section.content". Additionally, when working inside the header, the last link li element should always have the class ".li" added.

	The header can be changed to different colors using the class attribute. The standard is red, but can be change to blue, light green, brown, etc. The colors are all based off the Material Design color scheme, which can be found at https://design.google.com and other sources.

SECTION 2: Title Section
	Found as "section.title", there are five main parts that go into the title section: the title of the blog, the description of the blog, break lines (how many depends on how much spacing you want), a line "hr" tag (to separate the title/description from the start date), and the start date info ("default says Starts at October 2016").

	SECTION 2a: Title of the blog
		The "h1" tag found in the title section.
		Give your blog a creative title! Use italics, bolds, underlines, who cares! Unleash your creativity.

	SECTION 2b: Description of the blog
		The "h4" tag found in the title section.

	SECTION 2c: Break lines.
		Depending on how much spacing that you want, add more/less "br" tags.

	SECTION 2d: Line
		The "hr" tag.

	SECTION 2e: Start date
		Tells when the blog starts in the "h5" tag.

	The title section can also be changed to different colors using the class attribute. The standard is red, but can be change to blue, light green, brown, etc. The colors are all based off the Material Design color scheme, which can be found at https://design.google.com and other sources.

SECTION 3: Content
	Where the articles are. "section.content".

	SECTION 3a: Articles
		Every article "div.article" has a title "h3.title", a date and author "h5.desc" (make sure you keep the date format m/d/yy or mm/d/yy or m/dd/yy or mm/dd/yy), and a picture "div.img img". Additional header tags may be added without making things look weird.

	SECTION 3b: Everything else
		Everything else is pretty straight forward.

SECTION 4: Actual articles
	material_it.blog.html, material_it.blog.css, material_it.blog.js
	Everything on the article itself is pretty simple to understand. Don't forget that you can add blockquotes!

SECTION 5: About page
	material_it.about.html, material_it.about.css
	Simple. Don't make it to complex.

SECTION 5: Contact page
	material_it.contact.html, material_it.contact.css
	WARNING: PHP email file is not included. Other than that, it is pretty much all set up.
